## The Pitch:

      Fans of the popular show, The Office, can now find video games based on the personality of their favorite character!


## A.  Commitments as a project team:

  * Keep other team members informed and transfer knowledge to others when applicable.
  * Focus on what is best for the project as a whole.
  * Give everyone the opportunity for equal participation (draw out introverts and balance extroverts).
  * Be open to new approaches and listen to new ideas.
  * Get input from the entire team before a decision is made. If this isn’t feasible, at least get input from key people.
  * Attack problems or issues – not the person. When at a roadblock, console.log(math.random…)

## Things to Consider (If time allows):

 * Animation (Hover)
